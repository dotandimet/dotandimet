### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of the stuff I've got on GitHub falls into one of two categories: CPAN modules
(Perl) or Role-playing game utilities written in Javascript (usually unfinished).

### CPAN Modules (Perl)

I Released The following modules on CPAN, all based on the Mojolicious Web Framework

- [Mojo::Feed](https://github.com/dotandimet/Mojo-Feed) (2014 - 2020) - is an RSS parser [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo%3A%3AFeed)
- Mojo::UserAgent::Role::Queued (2017 - 2018) - adds a queue to a popular Perl asynchronous web client library to control the number of concurrent requests [CPAN] [Github]
